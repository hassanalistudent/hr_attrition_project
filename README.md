🚀 From Descriptive Insights to Predictive Power
After six months of hands-on experience in financial and HR analytics at Clustox, I’ve taken a major step forward—from building descriptive dashboards to developing predictive models. This project marks the beginning of that journey.

🔍 Project 1: HR Attrition Predictor
Using a Kaggle dataset focused on employee attrition, I built a binary classification model with XGBoost to predict churn risk. The model is tailored to the organizational context of the data and serves as a proof-of-concept for applying predictive analytics in HR decision-making.

📊 Model Performance
Accuracy: 82%

ROC-AUC Score: 0.775

Precision (Attrition class): 0.45

Confusion Matrix: [[220, 27], [25, 22]] To address class imbalance, I applied resampling techniques to improve detection of the minority class (employees likely to leave).
